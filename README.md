# bridge-mobile

Mobile app for bridging social networks, focused on interoperability and user control.

This is demo* code to test the hypothesis that it is possible to build a mobile social app that: 

- has a familiar user experience
- aggregates data from different platforms
- authenticates identity from different platforms
- uses a data structure optimized for decentralized networks, but makes it easy to import and modify posts
- connects to server for convenience, but can publish posts p2p through a decentralized data store

See bridge-serve for backend code and data structure rationale.

*Experimental, work-in-progress, totally unusable right now.

Would be nice to have: 

- User-configurable curation for feeds; algorithmic transparency
- Highly customizable user interface over common data structure
